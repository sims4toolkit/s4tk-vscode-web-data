<p>Glob patterns are used to find files whose paths have something in common. You can read this <a href="https://www.malikbrowne.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-glob-patterns/" target="_blank">beginner's guide to glob patterns</a> for a more complete introduction, but for the purposes of the <a href="#/learn/s4tk-config">S4TK Config</a>, all you need to know is that <code>*</code> means "any number of characters in a single file or folder name," and <code>**</code> means "any number of subfolders with any name."</p><hr><div class="paragraphs"><h2>Understanding Glob Patterns</h2><p>The S4TK config makes use of glob patterns to build files into packages, so you need to at least somewhat understand how they work. The best way to understand globs is through examples:</p><ul><li><code>**/*</code> &rarr; Every file in every subfolder</li><li><code>**/*.xml</code> &rarr; Every XML file in every subfolder</li><li><code>**/buff_*.xml</code> &rarr; Every XML file that begins with "buff_" in every subfolder</li><li><code>example/*.xml</code> &rarr; Every XML file in the "example" folder, but not within any deeper subfolders</li><li><code>example/**/*.xml</code> &rarr; Every XML file in the "example" folder, including all of its nested subfolders</li></ul><p>Glob patterns can get as granular as you need them to be, but for the purposes of the S4TK config, it's probably easiest to group your files in one subfolder per package, such as:</p><div class="feature-img-wrapper"><img class="feature-img" data-src="config-glob-example.png" alt="Screenshot of File Explorer and S4TK Config"><p class="text-sm text-subtle">Sample S4TK Project Structure and Globs</p></div><p>This structure and config would produce two packages, where the first contains every file within the <code>core</code> and <code>strings</code> folders, and the second contains everything in <code>some-add-on</code>. You'll notice that the glob patterns are relative to the source folder, <code>src</code>.</p><p class="footnote">You can achieve these same results by using <code>"include": ["**/*"]</code> and <code>"exclude": ["some-add-on/**/*"]</code> for the first package.</p></div><hr><div class="paragraphs"><h2>Important Notes</h2><p>These notes are specific to Node's most popular globbing package, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob" target="_blank">glob</a>.</p><h4 class="mt-4">case-insensitivity</h4><p>Glob patterns are case-insensitive, meaning that any characters you use in glob patterns will ignore case. For example, <code>buff_*.xml</code> would match both "buff_Example.xml" and "Buff_Example.xml".</p><h4 class="mt-4">always use forward slashes</h4><p>This isn't entirely relevant to the S4TK extension since it will normalize your paths for you anyways (i.e. if you use Windows paths, it will convert them for you), but it's good to know that the Node glob package <strong>always uses forward slashes</strong>, regardless of operating system. This means that your globs should look like <code>**/*</code> rather than <code>**\\*</code>, even on Windows.</p></div>
