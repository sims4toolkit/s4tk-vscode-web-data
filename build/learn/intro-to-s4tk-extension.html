It lets you build loose TS4 resources (such as tuning, SimData, and string tables) into packages, without having to write a single line of JavaScript yourself.</p><hr><div class="paragraphs"><h2>Where to Download</h2><p>If you haven't downloaded it yet, you can do so from the extension marketplace.
