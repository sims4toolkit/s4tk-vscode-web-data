<p>The build script checks for issues before and while it is running. If anything is critically wrong (such as a file whose key cannot be determined), the script will terminate with a detailed error message. Whether the build succeeds or not, a file called <code>BuildSummary.json</code> will be output that details everything the build process did.</p><hr><div class="paragraphs"><h2>Pre-Build Validation</h2><p>Before the build script runs, it verifies that:</p><ul><li>Every package has a non-empty, unique <code>filename</code></li><li>The <code>source</code> leads to an existing directory</li><li>All <code>destinations</code> lead to an existing directory</li><p class="footnote">Does not apply if <code>allowFolderCreation</code> is true</p><li>No two package's glob patterns match the same files</li><p class="footnote">Does not apply if <code>allowPackageOverlap</code> is true</p><li>Every source file is captured by at least one package's glob patterns</li><p class="footnote">Does not apply if <code>allowMissingSourceFiles</code> is true</p><li>Each package's glob patterns match at least one source file</li><p class="footnote">Does not apply if <code>allowEmptyPackages</code> is true</p></ul><p>If building in release mode, it also verifies that:</p><ul><li>Every ZIP has a non-empty <code>filename</code></li><li>Every ZIP's required packages are being generated</li><li>Every ZIP's <code>otherFiles</code> has at least one match if the <code>include</code> list is non-empty</li></ul></div><hr><div class="paragraphs"><h2>Runtime Validation</h2><p>For each individual file that the build script processes, it checks that:</p><ul><li>It is not corrupt and can be serialized to its binary format (if applicable)</li><li>It has a resource key specified by file name, comments, or inference</li><li>Each resource within the same package has a unique key</li><p class="footnote">Does not apply if <code>allowResourceKeyOverrides</code> is true</p><li>Each string within the same package has a unique key</li><p class="footnote">Does not apply if <code>allowStringKeyOverrides</code> is true</p></ul></div><hr><div class="paragraphs"><h2>Build Summary</h2><p>If any of the checks in the previous sections fail, a detailed error message will be displayed as a VS Code error message popup, and the <code>BuildSummary.json</code> file (generated in your project root) will show you exactly which file it failed on.
