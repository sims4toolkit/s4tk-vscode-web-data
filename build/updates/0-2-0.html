<p>S4TK VS Code v0.2.0 offers many new features <span class="danger">with one breaking change to the S4TK config</span>. This page explains everything new, removed, changed, and fixed since v0.1.0, including what you have to do to make your config work again.</p><hr><div class="paragraphs"><h2>Summary</h2><ul><li>Multiple workspaces in the same window are now supported.</li><li>Changes to the S4TK config file:</li><ul><li>Packages can now be based on other built packages to create variants of the same mod.</li><li>There are now settings to protect against repeated resource and string keys.</li><li>Multiple ZIPs are now supported in release build mode.</li></ul><li>There are now limited intellisense features for XML tuning:</li><ul><li><mark class="keystroke"><span class="macos">⌘ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark> click on a decimal tuning ID to jump to its file.</li><li>Hover over a class name in tuning to go to its TDESC.</li><li>Errors and warnings now display for tuning and SimData.</li></ul><li>New commands were added to the palette and context menus:</li><ul><li>Clone tuning files and their paired SimDatas with a new name and hash.</li><li>Create STBL fragments to edit or add strings without overriding an entire STBL.</li><li>Generate an S4TK project from a folder containing packages and loose XML, SimData, and STBL files.</li><li>Refresh project index / intellisense if it falls out of sync.</li></ul><li>Bug fixes and copy changes.</li></ul><p><span class="danger">There is one and only one breaking change to the S4TK config</span>. If you do not use release builds, you can simply delete the <code>releaseSettings</code> object entirely. If you do use release builds, you must create a <code>zips</code> list, like the following:</p><div class="feature-img-wrapper"><img class="feature-img" data-src="release-settings-0.2.0.png" alt="Screenshot of Release Settings Changes"><p class="text-sm text-subtle">Old Release Settings (left) &rarr; New Release Settings (right)</p></div><p>If your config has <code>releaseSettings</code>, you must make this change, or it will fail to load.</p></div><hr><div class="paragraphs"><h2>Changes to the S4TK Config</h2><p>Most changes to the config are additive and backwards-compatible, but <code>releaseSettings</code> has been completely overhauled to support multiple ZIPs. <span class="danger">Any configs containing the old syntax for a single ZIP will now fail to load</span>.</p><h4 class="mt-4">Additions</h4><ul><li><code>buildSettings.allowResourceKeyOverrides</code>: If false, causes the build script to fail if two resources with the same key are being written to the same package. False by default.</li><li><code>releaseSettings.zips</code>: Required list of objects containing information about each ZIP to create during release builds. Allowed to be empty if not used, but must be set if release settings exist.</li><ul><li><code>filename</code>: Same as property with same name in v0.1.0.</li><li><code>internalFolder</code>: Same as property with same name in v0.1.0.</li><li><code>otherFiles</code>: Same as property with same name in v0.1.0.</li><li><code>doNotGenerate</code>: If true, then this ZIP will neither be generated in memory nor written to disk.</li><li><code>packages</code>: List of names of packages to write to this ZIP. These packages must exist and be generated.</li></ul><p class="footnote">Read more under "Release Settings" on the <a href="http://localhost:5000/#/features/build-config">Build Customization</a> page.</p><li><code>stringTableSettings.allowStringKeyOverrides</code>: If false, causes the build script to fail if two strings with the same key are being written to string table(s) in the same package. False by default.</li><li><code>workspaceSettings</code>: Settings that affect workspace features, but not the build process.</li><ul><li><code>overrideIndexRoot</code>: Allows you to set the root of your workspace's index, if it's different than the source folder set in your build instructions. This index is used for intellisense and validation only, not builds.</li><p class="footnote">You likely do not have a use for this unless your project is complex and includes multiple packages that override each other's resources.</p></ul></ul><h4 class="mt-4">Changes</h4><ul><li><code>buildInstructions.packages</code>: The objects in this array have three new properties.</li><ul><li><code>doNotGenerate</code>: If true, then this package will neither be generated in memory nor written to disk.</li><li><code>doNotWrite</code>: If true, then this package will not be written to disk, even if it's being generated in memory.</li><li><code>duplicateFilesFrom</code>: List of names of built packages to base this one on.</li></ul><p class="footnote">Read more under "Build Instructions" on the <a href="http://localhost:5000/#/features/build-config">Build Customization</a> page.</p></ul><h4 class="mt-4">Removals</h4><ul><li>Every property on <code>releaseSettings</code> (except for <code>overrideDestinations</code>) has been removed, and are now available on the objects in the required <code>releaseSettings.zips</code> list.</li></ul></div><hr><div class="paragraphs"><h2>Intellisense Features</h2><h4 class="mt-4">Warnings &amp; Errors</h4><p>Warnings and errors now appear in opened files. Warnings are things that seem incorrect, and errors are things that are 100% guaranteed to cause the build script to terminate with an error, such as SimData not being valid.</p><p class="footnote">Warnings are inspired by those shown on the <a target="_blank" href="https://pkg.sims4toolkit.com/#/view">package viewer</a>.</p><h4 class="mt-4">Jump-to-Definition</h4><p>You can now hold <mark class="keystroke"><span class="macos">⌘ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark> and hover over a decimal tuning ID within any XML file to view the definition line of the associated tuning, and if you click, you will be brought to its file. This only works for files within the current workspace.</p><h4 class="mt-4">Class TDESC Links</h4><p>Hover over the class name in any tuning file to see a link to its <a href="https://tdesc.lot51.cc/" target="_blank">online TDESC</a>, click the link to launch the page in your browser.</p></div><hr><div class="paragraphs"><h2>New Commands</h2><h4 class="mt-4">"Clone With New Name"</h4><p>Available in context menus for XML files. Creates a copy of a tuning and its paired SimData, if it has one, that has a new name and automatically generated hash. If the file is of a type that is known to require 31 or 32 bit hashes, the hash will automatically be the correct number of bits.</p><h4 class="mt-4">"Create Fragment for STBL"</h4><p>Available in context menus for STBL JSONs. Creates another STBL JSON file, marked as a fragment, with the same meta data as the one the command was run on.</p><p class="footnote">Read more about STBL fragments in "Other Changes" at the bottom of this page.</p><h4 class="mt-4">"Convert Folder to S4TK Project"</h4><p>Available in the command palette. Select a folder containing packages and/or loose TS4 resources (tuning, SimData, STBLs, or files containing TGI file names), then select a folder to output the project to, and these files will be converted to a format that is compatible with the extension. The folder structure will be broken down by file type.</p><p class="footnote">If any XML files' resource keys do not match what S4TK would infer for them, an override comment is automatically inserted. The S4TK project is guaranteed to be using the same resource keys for every single file in the selected source folder.</p><h4 class="mt-4">"Refresh Project Index"</h4><p>Available in the command palette. Probably never has to be used, but available in case you ever need it.</p><p class="footnote">Indices are automatically updated as changes are detected in your config and source folder, so if you ever find a reason to use this command, please let me know what went wrong so I can fix it.</p></div><hr><div class="paragraphs"><h2>Other Changes</h2><h4 class="mt-4">String Table JSONs</h4><p>STBL JSONs can now be marked as fragments with <code>"fragment": true</code>. Being a fragment means that a string table's entries will either overwrite or be appended to another string table. The string table that it is a fragment of is determined by them having matching resource keys.</p><p class="footnote">Fragments are intended for use with the `duplicateFilesFrom` option in `buildInstructions.packages`; they can be used to add or overwrite individual strings without needing to overwrite the entire base string table.</p><h4 class="mt-4">Support for Deleted Records</h4><p>The package renderer now shows deleted records with the name [Deleted Record], and you can even add your own deleted records to your packages by creating a file with a TGI file name and a ".deleted" extension. A file marked as a deleted record will tell the game to act as though it does not exist.</p><p class="footnote">Using deleted records is generally not a great idea, but no other tool exists for this even though it is very easy, so I figured I'd add it.</p><h4 class="mt-4">Bug Fixes</h4><ul><li>"Copy as XML Reference" command regex has been fixed, it should now show up for every non-SimData XML file.</li><li>Content-changing CodeLenses will no longer appear in read-only documents, such as "Add String" in STBLs within packages.</li><li>S4TK configs and all related commands now work properly with multiple workspace folders.</li></ul></div>
