    This article is intended for Sims 4 modders who have never used VS Code
    before. If you are already familiar with VS Code or other IDEs, then feel
    free to skip ahead to
    <a href="#/learn/intro-to-s4tk-extension">Intro to the S4TK Extension</a>.
    If you'd like to learn about VS Code in general, rather than specifically
    using it for Sims 4 modding, you should instead read the
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs" target="_blank"
      >official docs</a
    >.

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      >Visual Studio Code</a
    >
    is a free, cross-platform code editor created by Microsoft. It is highly
    customizable thanks to its extension marketplace, where you can download
    add-ons that alter its appearance and/or abilities (just like mods!).

    Download for Windows, macOS, or Linux at the above link.

    VS Code works with actual files and folders on your computer's file system,
    rather than virtual documents within a package, like Sims 4 Studio does.
    Each project you work on in VS Code must exist within a single folder; when
    you open this folder in VS Code (<strong>File</strong> &gt;
    <strong>Open Folder...</strong> in the menu bar), it is called a workspace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within your workspace, you can create, view, edit, move, rename, and delete
    files, just as you would in <span class="macos">macOS Finder</span
    ><span class="windows">Windows Explorer</span>, but with a rich code editor.
    The workspace folder can also contain special files, such as the S4TK Config
    or the .vscode folder, which tell VS Code how to behave while working on
    your current project.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    You'll read more about the S4TK Config and .vscode folder in other articles.
