    In a few ways, VS Code is similar to Sims 4 Studio. The file explorer is on
    the left, the editor is on the right, and their editors are both powered by
    <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/" target="_blank"
      >Monaco</a
    >
    (which means they use many of the same keyboard shortcuts, such as
    <mark class="keystroke"
      ><span class="macos">âŒ˜ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke">F</mark> to find / replace).

    The biggest difference between them is that Sims 4 Studio works with
    packages while VS Code works with individual files on your computer. Most
    professional software development is done with individual files for a few
    reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have full control over your project's file structure</li>
    <li>You're not restricted to programs that can read packages</li>
    <li>You won't break your entire project if one file is corrupt</li>
    <li>You can edit one file without reading/writing the entire package</li>
    <li>You can use Git for source control and back your code up on GitHub</li>
  </ul>
