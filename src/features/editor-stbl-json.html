<p>
  JSON is the recommended format for string tables in S4TK, as they are easier
  to work with and can contain metadata.

  <h2>JSON Formats</h2>
  <p>
    STBL JSONs have intellisense and validation for several formats. There are
    two supported formats for entries (objects and arrays), as well as optional
    metadata in both. You don't need to worry about memorizing these formats,
    because the
    <a href="#/features/commands-create-files">file creation commands</a> and
    CodeLenses will do all of the work for you.

      STBL JSON Objects (Left) and Arrays (Right)
    </p>
  </div>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Objects vs. Arrays</h4>
  <p>
    Object STBLs use an object to map keys directly to their values, while array
    STBLs are a list of key/value pairs. Objects are easier to work with, but
    arrays are supported for compatibility with STBL Studio's default JSON
    export format.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    You can convert back and forth with a CodeLens at the top of the file.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Metadata</h4>
  <p>
    Metadata for STBLs include their locale, group, and instance base. At build
    time, the locale is used to turn the 56-bit instance base into a 64-bit
    instance ID. This metadata can be stored in STBL JSONs, so you don't have to
    use a long file name.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is highly recommended to add metadata to STBLs, because otherwise a
    random 56-bit hash will be used for your STBL instance, and the default
    locale you set in <a href="#/learn/s4tk-settings">S4TK Settings</a> will be
    assumed.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    You can insert metadata, if it's missing, with a CodeLens at the top of the
    file.

  <h2>Adding, Editing, and Using Strings</h2>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Adding</h4>
  <p>There are three ways to add new strings to a STBL JSON:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manually add entries by typing or pasting them in</li>
    <li>Click the "New String" CodeLens, then edit the value</li>
    <li>Use <a href="#/features/commands-stbl">commands</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    New strings will use a random, cryptographically-safe hash, which makes the
    chance of collisions exceedingly rare.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    Random hashes are generated in the same way as the
    <a href="#/features/commands-hashing" target="_blank">hashing commands</a>.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Editing</h4>
  <p>
    JSON is a plain text format, so just edit the values of entries directly.
    Delete key/value pairs to remove entries. You can also rearrange entries by
    copy/pasting, or by higlighting an entry and moving it with
    <mark class="keystroke macos">⌥ OPT</mark
    ><mark class="keystroke windows">ALT</mark>&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke"
      >&uarr;</mark
    >&nbsp;/&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke">&darr;</mark>.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Using</h4>
  <p>
    You can press
    <mark class="keystroke"
      ><span class="macos">⌘ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke">F</mark> to search the whole document for
    strings or keys, and press the "Copy as XML" CodeLens to quickly save the
    string and its comment (e.g. <code>0x12345678&lt;!--Something--&gt;</code>)
    to your clipboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Copying a string as XML will show a confirmation popup, but you can disable
    this in <a href="#/learn/s4tk-settings" target="_blank">S4TK Settings</a>.
