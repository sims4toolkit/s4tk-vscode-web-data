<p>
  The build script checks for potential warnings and errors before and while the
  build script is running. If anything is seriously wrong, the build script will
  terminate with a detailed error message. Whether the build succeeds or not, a
  file called <code>BuildSummary.json</code> will be output that details how the
  config was interpreted and which specific files had problems.

  <h2>Pre-Build Validation</h2>
  <p>Before the build script runs, it verifies some things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every package has a non-empty, unique <code>filename</code></li>

    <li>The <code>source</code> leads to an existing directory</li>

    <li>All <code>destinations</code> lead to an existing directory</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Does not apply if <code>allowFolderCreation</code> is true
    </p>

    <li>No two package's glob patterns match the same files</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Does not apply if <code>allowPackageOverlap</code> is true
    </p>

    <li>
      Every source file is captured by at least one package's glob patterns
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Does not apply if <code>allowMissingSourceFiles</code> is true
    </p>

    <li>Each package's glob patterns match at least one source file</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Does not apply if <code>allowEmptyPackages</code> is true
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p>If building in release mode, some extra checks are done:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The ZIP has a non-empty <code>filename</code></li>
    <li>
      If the ZIP's <code>include</code> paths is non-empty, at least one file is
      matched
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Runtime Validation</h2>
  <p>While the build script is running, it may terminate with an error if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Any resources are corrupt or could otherwise not be built into their TS4
      binary formats (string tables, SimData, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Any tuning/SimData file's resource key could not be determined by TGI file
      names, S4TK comments, or inference
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Build Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>BuildSummary.json</code> file is generated at your project's root
    and contains information that helps you debug your project and/or config.
