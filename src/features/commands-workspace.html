  <h2>Command Palette</h2>
  <p>
    To open the command palette, press
    <mark class="keystroke"
      ><span class="macos">⌘ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke"><span class="macos">⇧&nbsp;</span>SHIFT</mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke">P</mark>. Then, you can run these commands:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Convert Folder to S4TK Project</strong>: Select a folder
      containing packages and/or loose TS4 resources, then select a folder to
      output the project to, and these files will be converted to a format that
      is compatible with the extension. The folder structure will be broken down
      by file type.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      The S4TK project is guaranteed to use the same resource keys for every
      single file in the selected source folder. If inference doesn't match, an
      override comment is inserted for you.
    </p>
    <li>
      <strong>Refresh Project Index</strong>: Refresh the index for this
      project. Probably never has to be used, but available just in case.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      If you ever find that the index is incorrect or has fallen out of sync,
      please
