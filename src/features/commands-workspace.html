<p>
  These are commands that relate to your S4TK project setup, rather than those
  for building.

  <h2>Command Palette</h2>
  <p>
    To open the command palette, press
    <mark class="keystroke"
      ><span class="macos">⌘ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke"><span class="macos">⇧&nbsp;</span>SHIFT</mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke">P</mark>. Then, you can run commands for
    reloading the config, creating a config, or generating a sample project:
  </p>
  <div class="feature-img-wrapper">
    <img
      class="feature-img"
      data-src="workspace-commands.png"
      alt="Screenshot of Command Palette"
    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">Workspace Commands in Command Palette</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Reloading the config is generally not necessary because the config will
    automatically reload every time you save an edit, however, it can be used
    when the config is edited by an external program, such as
    <span class="macos">TextEdit</span><span class="windows">Notepad</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the "create" commands are <strong>non-destructive</strong>,
    meaning that they will never overwrite files that already exist. In fact, an
    error message will display if you attempt to run them in a workspace that
    already has an S4TK config.

  <h2>Context Menus</h2>
  <p>
    You can generate the config or sample workspace by right-clicking the root
    workspace folder and selecting the commands in the context menu. For
