<p>
  S4TK infers most resources' keys (type, group, and instance) automatically,
  but allows them to be manually set if needed.

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    There are several ways for the build script to know which resource key to
    use for a file. In order of precedence, they are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the file is within another package and therefore already has a key
    </li>
    <li>
      If the name of the file contains the type, group, and instance as hex
      numbers
    </li>
    <li>
      (Tuning/SimData only) If the type, group, and instance are overridden in a
      comment
    </li>
    <li>
      (Tuning/SimData only) If the type, group, and instance can be inferred
      from the file contents
    </li>
    <li>
      (STBL JSON only) If metadata (group, locale, and instance base) are
      specified in the JSON
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>For most users, it is recommended to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Let S4TK infer keys for tuning/SimData</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Use comments to override inferred type/group/instance only when needed
    </p>
    <li>Use STBL JSONs with metadata rather than binary STBLs</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      S4TK's STBL JSON format lets you set the group, locale, and instance base
    </p>
    <li>Leave other kinds of files within packages</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      You can use TGI file names if you prefer, but they clutter your file
      explorer
    </p>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tuning &amp; SimData Key Inference</h2>
  <p>
    Your tuning files do not need to be named or structured in any particular
    way for their keys to be inferred, but there are restrictions on SimData. A
    tuning's SimData must:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Be in the same directory as its paired tuning file</li>
    <li>
      Have the same file name, but with a <code>.SimData.xml</code> extension
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If any types, groups, or instances cannot be inferred (such as when a new
    tuning type has been added to the game but not to S4TK), your build will
    fail with an error message, letting you know that it must be manually set.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Tuning</h4>
  <p>
    Module tuning (<code>&lt;M&gt;</code> tag) always uses the generic tuning
    type, but instance tuning (<code>&lt;I&gt;</code> tag)'s type is inferred
    from its <code>i</code> attribute<span class="superscript">*</span>.
    Instance IDs for both are inferred from the <code>s</code> attribute, and
    the group is assumed to be 0. If you need a group other than 0 (such as for
    an override), then you must manually set it.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    <span class="superscript">*</span> The <code>i</code> attribute is parsed
    with <code>TuningResourceType.parseAttr()</code>, but instead of defaulting
    to generic tuning, an error is thrown if no match is found. For more info,
    read

      >the docs</a
    >
    or its linked source code.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">SimData</h4>
  <p>
    SimData files always use the SimData type, but there must be a paired tuning
    file in order to infer to group and instance. The group is determined by
    using the paired tuning's type<span class="superscript">*</span>, and the
    instance is just copied over. If the SimData intentionally does not have a
    paired tuning, you'll have to manually set the group/instance.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    <span class="superscript">*</span> The group is parsed with
    <code>SimDataGroup.getForTuning()</code>. Some uncommon tuning types (like
    modules and client files) might not have a 1:1 mapping with SimData groups.

  <h2>Overriding Inference With Comments</h2>
  <p>
    For XML resources like tuning and SimData, you can use a special comment at
    the top of the file to tell S4TK which type, group, and/or instance to use,
    rather than inferring them. You can generate this comment by clicking the
    Type / Group / Instance buttons that appear at the top of tuning / SimData
    files, and delete it by simply removing the comment from the XML.
  </p>
  <div class="feature-img-wrapper">

      class="feature-img"

    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">
      Key Override CodeLenses (Top) and Comment (Bottom)
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    You do not have to override all 3. If you only need to set the group, then
    click the "Group" CodeLens button and enter your group manually. The type
    and instance will still be inferred.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="paragraphs">
  <h2>Manual Keys With File Names</h2>
  <p>
    S4TK supports including the type, group, and instance in file names. This is
    useful for resources whose keys can neither be inferred nor overridden with
    an XML comment, such as binary string tables, object definitions, DST
    images, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    The type and group must be 8 digit hex numbers, and the instance must be a
    16 digit hex number. All three must be present and separated by some non-hex
    character, such as <code>_</code> or <code>!</code>. Other than the TGI
    information, the file name can contain anything else you want, but note that
    the extension should be appropriate for the data contained in the file, such
    as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>6017E896_00000000_1234567890ABCDEF.nameOfFile.xml</code></li>
    <li>
      <code>545AC67A.0017E8F6.1234567890ABCDEF.nameOfFile.SimData.xml</code>
    </li>
    <li><code>220557DA!80000000!0034567890ABCDEF.English.stbl</code></li>
    <li><code>220557DA-80000000-0034567890ABCDEF.English.stbl.json</code></li>
    <li><code>00B2D882_00000000_1234567890ABCDEF.binary</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note that SimDatas can either be binary or XML, and string tables can either
    be binary or JSON - the build script will check and serialize them as
    needed. All other resources will be inserted into the package exactly as-is,
    byte for byte.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong class="danger">NOTE:</strong> Though TGI file names are supported,
    it is recommended to make use of S4TK's inference and overrides for tuning /
    SimData, use STBL JSONs with metadata, and leave your other files within
    packages.

  <h2>Note on String Table Keys</h2>
  <p>
    String tables always use type <code>220557DA</code>, and their group should
    be one of <code>00000000</code> or <code>80000000</code>. Their instance
    should be a unique FNV56 hash, and the top 8 bits should be the appropriate
    <a
      href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/enums/StringTableLocale"
      target="_blank"
      >locale code</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    JSON is the recommended format for string tables in S4TK, not only because
    they are easier to use and edit, but because they allow you to specify the
    group, locale, and instance base within the file itself. If using binary
    string tables,
    <strong class="danger">you must use TGI file names</strong>, or else the
    instance will be a random FNV56 and your default locale will be assumed.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    The build summary will flag string tables whose instances were generated on
    the fly for your awareness.
  </p>
