<p>
  S4TK has always been intended for making gameplay mods, so it only supports
  tuning, SimData, and string tables as first-class citizens. However, all other
  Sims 4 resources can be built as well via packages or TGI file names.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  "TGI file names" refers to file names that contain the type, group, and
  instance, such as <code>12345678_00000000_0123456789ABCDEF.binary</code>

  <h2>Tuning &amp; SimData</h2>
  <p>
    All loose tuning files must have an <code>.xml</code> extension, and their
    SimDatas must be in the same folder and have the same name, but with a
    <code>.SimData.xml</code> extension. If using these extensions, they must be
    plain-text (i.e., no binary SimDatas).
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    You are allowed to use TGI file names for tuning and SimData, but it is
    highly advised against as it will cause issues with intellisense.
  </p>

  <h2>String Tables</h2>
  <p>
    String tables can be
    <a href="#/features/editor-stbl-binary">binary</a> or
    <a href="#/features/editor-stbl-json">JSON</a>, but JSON is highly
    recommended. JSON string tables must use the
    <code>.stbl.json</code> extension, and binary string tables must have TGI
    file names.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="paragraphs">
  <h2>Deleted Records</h2>
  <p>
    Deleted records are resources with a flag that tells the game to treat them
    like they don't exist. You can use deleted records to delete vanilla files,
    or to deactivate files in your own mod via an add-on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deleted records must use a TGI file name with the extension
    <code>.deleted</code>. For instance, if you want to delete a file with the
    key 12345678-00000000-0123456789ABCDEF, you can use a file named
    <code>12345678_00000000_0123456789ABCDEF.deleted</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong class="danger">Warning:</strong> It is generally not a good idea to
    use deleted records. S4TK only supports them because there is no other tool
    that exists for them, and I wanted to provide people with a way to do it if
    they want to.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    S4S does not render deleted records, so you can only see them with the
    package renderer in VS Code or the online S4TK package viewer.
  </p>

  <h2>All Other Resources</h2>
  <p>
    All other resources, such as DDS images, object definitions, and ASMs must
    either be kept in packages or written as binary files using TGI file names.
    Packages are recommended, since you can edit them with S4S as needed.
