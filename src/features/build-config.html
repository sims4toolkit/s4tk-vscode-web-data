<p>
  The build script is controlled by the
  <a href="#/learn/s4tk-config" target="_blank">S4TK Config</a>, which specifies
  the files that are built to each package, where the packages are written, and
  what kind of debug information to generate.

  <h2>Types of Builds</h2>
  <p>There are three types of builds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Build</strong>: Build your source files into packages and write
      them to disk.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Probably what you want to use during normal development.
    </p>

    <li>
      <strong>Dry Run</strong>: Run the build process and generate debug info,
      but don't write to disk.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Useful for debugging the config file without overwriting any existing
      files.
    </p>

    <li>
      <strong>Release</strong>: Run a normal built, but write all packages and
      other files into a ZIP.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Useful for bundling your package(s) with your scripts, READMEs, etc.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All three kinds of builds will fail with a detailed error message if
    something in your project isn't right, such as a tuning file whose type
    cannot be inferred. They also output a file called
    <code>BuildSummary.json</code> that details what went on during the build
    process (useful for debugging / confirmation).
  </p>

<div class="paragraphs">
  <h2>Build Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>buildInstructions</code> section specifies which files to build to
    which packages:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>source</code>: What directory your source files are in.</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Path can either be absolute or relative to the root folder.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>destinations</code>: Which directories your built packages should be
      written to.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Paths can either be absolute or relative to the root folder.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>packages</code>: Which source files should be written to which
      packages.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Any files that (1) match at least one glob pattern in
      <code>include</code> and (2) do not match any glob patterns in
      <code>exclude</code> will be written to a package named
      <code>filename</code>. Glob patterns are relative to the
      <code>source</code> folder.
    </p>
  </ul>

<div class="paragraphs">
  <h2>Build Settings</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>buildSettings</code> section controls safeguards and debug info:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>allowEmptyPackages</code>: Whether or not a package's glob patterns
      are allowed to not have any matches.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Making this <code>true</code> means that some packages might be empty.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>allowFolderCreation</code>: Whether or not the build script is
      allowed to create folders if a destination does not exist.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Making this <code>true</code> means you might be creating a folder
      somewhere you did not intend to if your path was incorrect. It's
      recommended to do a dry run and check your desitinations before setting
      this to <code>true</code>.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>allowMissingSourceFolders</code>: Whether or not every single file
      within your source folder must be written to a package.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Making this <code>true</code> means some of your source files might not be
      included in any packages.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>allowPackageOverlap</code>: Whether or not multiple packages are
      allowed to contain the same source file.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Making this <code>true</code> means some of your source files might be
      duplicated.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>outputBuildSummary</code>: What kind build summary to generate
      (<code>"none"</code>, <code>"partial"</code>, or <code>"full"</code>).
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Partial build summaries only include how the config was interpreted and
      any warnings or errors the build script ran in to. Full summaries also
      include a comprehensive list of every source file that was written to
      every package, including their inferred resource keys.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For most users, all of the "allow" settings should be false. Read more about
    the <a href="#/learn/s4tk-config" target="_blank">S4TK Config</a> to
    understand how these settings protect you against common bugs with glob
    patterns.
  </p>

<div class="paragraphs">
  <h2>Release Settings</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>releaseSettings</code> section specifies your ZIPs made for
    release:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>filename</code>: The name of the generated ZIP file.</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      If the name does not end in <code>.zip</code>, it will automatically be
      appended.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>internalFolder</code>: What to name the folder within the ZIP, if
      anything.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      If left null or empty, then there will be no internal folder - files will
      be written directly to the ZIP.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>otherFiles</code>: List of other files to include in the ZIP, such
      as scripts or READMEs.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">List of glob patterns relative to the project root.</p>
  </ul>
</div>

<hr />

<div class="paragraphs">
  <h2>String Table Settings</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>stringTableSettings</code> section includes options for strings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>defaultStringTable</code>: Path to the default string table.</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      The default string table is the one that strings are added to via
      <a href="#/features/commands-stbl">commands</a>.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>generateMissingLocales</code>: Whether or not to generate missing
      strings for other locales.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      This will create STBLs for each missing locale, and/or fill in invidual
      strings that are missing within them (from the default locale).
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>mergeStringTablesInSamePackage</code>: Make it so there is only one
      string table per built package.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      If more than one string table is being written to one package, they are
      merged. The ID of the first is used.
    </p>
  </ul>
</div>
