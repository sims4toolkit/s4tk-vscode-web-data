<p>
  The build script is controlled by the
  <a href="#/learn/s4tk-config" target="_blank">S4TK Config</a>, which specifies
  the files that are built to each package, where the packages are written, and
  what kind of debug information to generate.
</p>

<div class="paragraphs">
  <h2>Types of Builds</h2>
  <p>There are three types of builds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Build</strong>: Build your source files into packages and write
      them to disk.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Probably what you want to use during normal development.
    </p>

    <li>
      <strong>Dry Run</strong>: Run the build process and generate debug info,
      but don't write to disk.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Useful for debugging the config file without overwriting any existing
      files.
    </p>

    <li>
      <strong>Release</strong>: Run a normal build, but write packages and/or
      other files into ZIPs.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Useful for bundling your package(s) with your scripts, READMEs, etc.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All three kinds of builds will fail with a detailed error message if
    something in your project isn't right, such as a tuning file whose type
    cannot be inferred. They also output a file called
    <code>BuildSummary.json</code> that details what went on during the build
    process (useful for debugging / confirmation).

  <h2>Build Instructions</h2>

  <p>
    The <code>buildInstructions</code> section specifies which files to build to
    which packages:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>source</code>: What directory your source files are in.</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Path can either be absolute or relative to the root folder.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>destinations</code>: Which directories your built packages should be
      written to.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Paths can either be absolute or relative to the root folder.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>packages</code>: Which source files should be written to which
      packages.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Any files that (1) match at least one glob pattern in
      <code>include</code> and (2) do not match any glob patterns in
      <code>exclude</code> will be written to a package named
      <code>filename</code>. Glob patterns are relative to the
      <code>source</code> folder.
    </p>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The <code>buildInstructions.packages</code> list contains objects with the
    following properties:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>filename</code>: Name of the package file to create.</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      If the name does not end in <code>.package</code>, it will automatically
      be appended.
    </p>

    <li><code>include</code>: List of glob patterns to include.</li>
    <p class="footnote">Patterns are relative to the source folder.</p>

    <li>
      <code>exclude</code>: List of glob patterns to exclude, even if they match
      an include pattern.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">Patterns are relative to the source folder.</p>

    <li>
      <code>duplicateFilesFrom</code>: List of packages to base this one on. All
      packages must have been generated before this one.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">Useful for creating different "flavors" of one mod.</p>

    <li>
      <code>doNotGenerate</code>: If true, then neither generate nor write this
      package to disk.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Useful for "commenting out" a package without messing up glob validation.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>doNotWrite</code>: If true, then do not write this package to disk
      even if it is generated.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Useful for not writing a package that still needs to be generated because
      another package depends on it.
    </p>
  </ul>

  <h2>Build Settings</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>buildSettings</code> section controls safeguards and debug info:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>allowEmptyPackages</code>: Whether or not a package's glob patterns
      are allowed to not have any matches.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Making this <code>true</code> means that some packages might be empty.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>allowFolderCreation</code>: Whether or not the build script is
      allowed to create folders if a destination does not exist.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Making this <code>true</code> means you might be creating a folder
      somewhere you did not intend to if your path was incorrect. It's
      recommended to do a dry run and check your desitinations before setting
      this to <code>true</code>.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>allowMissingSourceFolders</code>: Whether or not every single file
      within your source folder must be written to a package.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Making this <code>true</code> means some of your source files might not be
      included in any packages.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>allowPackageOverlap</code>: Whether or not multiple packages are
      allowed to contain the same source file.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Making this <code>true</code> means some of your source files might be
      duplicated.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>allowResourceKeyOverrides</code>: Whether or not multiple files in
      the same package are allowed to have the same key.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Making this <code>true</code> means some of your source files might be
      overriding each other.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>outputBuildSummary</code>: What kind build summary to generate
      (<code>"none"</code>, <code>"partial"</code>, or <code>"full"</code>).
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Partial build summaries only include how the config was interpreted and
      any warnings or errors the build script ran in to. Full summaries also
      include a comprehensive list of every source file that was written to
      every package, including their inferred resource keys.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For most users, all of the "allow" settings should be false. Read more about
    the <a href="#/learn/s4tk-config" target="_blank">S4TK Config</a> to
    understand how these settings protect you against common bugs with glob
    patterns.

  <h2>Release Settings</h2>

  <p>
    The <code>releaseSettings</code> section specifies your ZIPs made for
    release:

      <code>overrideDestinations</code>: The folder(s) to write your ZIPs to, if
      different from your build instruction's destinations.

  <p>
    The <code>releaseSettings.zips</code> list contains information about each
    ZIP:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>filename</code>: The name of the generated ZIP file.</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      If the name does not end in <code>.zip</code>, it will automatically be
      appended.
    </p>

    <li><code>packages</code>: List of packages to include in this ZIP.</li>
    <p class="footnote">Must include packages that are being generated.</p>

    <li>
      <code>internalFolder</code>: What to name the folder within the ZIP, if
      anything.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      If left null or empty, then there will be no internal folder - files will
      be written directly to the ZIP.
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>otherFiles</code>: List of other files to include in the ZIP, such
      as scripts or READMEs.

  <h2>String Table Settings</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>stringTableSettings</code> section includes options for strings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>allowStringKeyOverrides</code>: Whether or not multiple strings in
      the same package are allowed to have the same key.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Making this <code>true</code> means some of your strings might be
      overriding each other.

    <li><code>defaultStringTable</code>: Path to the default string table.</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      The default string table is the one that strings are added to via

    <li>
      <code>generateMissingLocales</code>: Whether or not to generate missing
      strings for other locales.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      This will create STBLs for each missing locale, and/or fill in invidual
      strings that are missing within them (from the default locale).
    </p>

    <li>
      <code>mergeStringTablesInSamePackage</code>: Make it so there is only one
      string table per built package.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      If more than one string table is being written to one package, they are
      merged. The ID of the first is used.

  <h2>Workspace Settings</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>workspaceSettings</code> section includes options that do not

      <code>overrideIndexRoot</code>: The root to use for the index, if
      different from the source folder in your build instructions.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      You likely have no use for this unless your project is complex and has
