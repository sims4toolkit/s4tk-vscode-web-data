<p>
  The S4TK extension adds functionality on XML files for formatting, resource
  keys, and copying references.

  <h2>CodeLenses</h2>
  <p>
    Tuning and SimData both contain the same CodeLenses at the top of the file:
  </p>
  <div class="feature-img-wrapper">
    <img
      class="feature-img"
      data-src="TODO.png"
      alt="Screenshot of XML CodeLenses"
    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">
      Available CodeLenses in Tuning and SimData
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    You can format your XML by clicking "Format". It will use the number of
    spaces set in your
    <a href="#/learn/s4tk-settings" target="_blank">VS Code settings</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, S4TK automatically infers resource keys for tuning and
    SimData, and will display them in the three other CodeLenses as hex numbers.
    If you need to override one and set it manually, then just click the
    CodeLens and a comment will be inserted. For more information, read
    <a href="#/features/resource-keys">Resource Keys</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    If one of the resource key values says "Unknown", S4TK could not infer it,
    and it must be manually set.
  </p>
</div>

  <h2>Commands</h2>
  <p>
    There is only one command available on XML files, and it applies to Tuning
    only, not SimData. Right-click on the tuning file in either the file
    explorer or editor tabs, and you will see the following option:
  </p>
  <div class="feature-img-wrapper">
    <img
      class="feature-img"
      data-src="TODO.png"
      alt="Screenshot of Tuning File Context Menu"
    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">
      "Copy as XML Reference" Command in the Context Menu
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    This will copy the tuning file as an XML reference, such as
    <code>12345&lt;!--filename--&gt;</code>, so you can paste it into another
    tuning file.
  </p>
</div>
