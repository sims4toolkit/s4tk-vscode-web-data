  You can create string tables, configs, and sample projects quickly with
  commands.

  <h2>Command Palette</h2>
  <p>
    To open the command palette, press
    <mark class="keystroke"
      ><span class="macos">⌘ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke"><span class="macos">⇧&nbsp;</span>SHIFT</mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke">P</mark>. Then, you can run commands to
    create files:

    <img
      class="feature-img"
      data-src="create-file-commands.png"
      alt="Screenshot of Command Palette"
    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">Workspace Commands in Command Palette</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Creating a STBL from the command palette will prompt you for a directory to
    create it in. The config and sample project will always generate at the root
    of the current VS Code workspace, since that is where the config must be.
  </p>
  <p>
    These commands are <strong>non-destructive</strong>, meaning they will not
    overwrite files that already exist. Attempting to create a STBL that exists
    will open the existing file, while attempting to create a config or sample
    project will fail.
  </p>

  <h2>Context Menus</h2>
  <p>
    You can generate the config or sample workspace by right-clicking the root
    workspace folder and selecting the commands in the context menu. For
    screenshots and more information, visit
    <a href="/#/learn/s4tk-config">S4TK Config</a> and
    <a href="#/learn/sample-s4tk-project">Sample S4TK Project</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also create a JSON string table with a context menu command, but
    only when there is an S4TK config file loaded. Right-click on any folder
    within your workspace in order to create a string table JSON.

    The command to create a binary string table is intentionally excluded, as
    it's not recommended to use them in the first place.
