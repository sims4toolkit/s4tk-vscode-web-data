<div class="paragraphs">
  <h2>New Tuning Type</h2>

  <p>
    Tunings with <code>i="business_rule"</code> will now automatically use the
    BusinessRule (B8E58C6C) tuning type.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="paragraphs">
  <h2>New Command</h2>

  <h4 class="mt-4">"Rename / Rehash Tuning File"</h4>
  <p>
    Available in context menus for XML files. Renames a tuning and its paired
    SimData, if it has one, and automatically generates a new hash. If the file
    is known to require 31 or 32 bit hashes, the hash will be the correct size.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    This command is nearly identical to the existing "Clone With New Name"
    command, but without keeping the original file.
