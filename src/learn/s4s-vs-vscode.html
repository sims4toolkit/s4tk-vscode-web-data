  <a href="https://sims4studio.com/" target="_blank">Sims 4 Studio</a> is an
  indespensible TS4 modding tool, especially for CC creation and
  non-build-related functionality like extracting tuning. The S4TK extension for
  VS Code is <em>not</em> intended to fully replace it, but it does make
  gameplay mod creation much closer to how "real" software development is done.

  <h2>Initial Impressions</h2>
  <p>
    In a few ways, VS Code is similar to Sims 4 Studio. The file explorer is on
    the left, the editor is on the right, and their editors are both powered by
    <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/" target="_blank"
      >Monaco</a
    >
    (which means they use many of the same keyboard shortcuts, such as
    <mark class="keystroke"
      ><span class="macos">âŒ˜ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke">F</mark> to find / replace).
  </p>
  <p>
    However, VS Code has several advantages right off the bat, such as being
    able to open multiple editors at once, completely hiding the file explorer
    so you can focus on your code, and having access to third-party extensions.

  <p>
    Aside from the UI, there is one critical difference: S4S edits entire
    packages, and VS Code edits individual files. S4S treats packages as your
    source code (i.e. files you edit to make your mod), while VS Code with S4TK
    treats packages as build artifacts (i.e. files that are generated by an
    automated build process).
  </p>
  <p>
    Both of these approaches have their pros and cons, and for many mod
    creators, editing packages directly may still be necessary. If you opt to
    use the S4TK VS Code extension, you will likely still have to use S4S for
    some tasks.

  <h2>Advantages of VS Code with S4TK</h2>
  <h4>This is how "real" software dev is done</h4>
  <p>
    The primary draw of Sims 4 Toolkit is that it lets you make mods from loose
    XML files rather than packages, but why does this matter? Most software
    development is done with individual text files rather than binary ones for
    many reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have full control over your project's file structure</li>
    <li>You're not restricted to programs that can read packages</li>
    <li>You won't break your entire project if one file is corrupt</li>
    <li>You can edit one file without reading/writing the entire package</li>
    <li>You can use Git for source control and back your code up on GitHub</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Resource keys are automatic</h4>
  <p>
    Additionally, the S4TK extension handles resource keys for you. You do not
    have to include them in file names or set them in an index; S4TK will infer
    the correct type, group, and instance for tuning / SimData from their
    contents.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    If types, groups, and/or instances cannot be inferred, you can override them
    with an XML comment.
  </p>
  <h4 class="mt-4">No scripting required</h4>
  <p>
    The best part is, you don't have to write a single line of code to reap
    these benefits, since the S4TK VS Code extension handles the build script
    for you. All you have to do is edit a JSON file (the S4TK Config) to tell it
    which files belong in which packages.

  <h2>Limitations of VS Code with S4TK</h2>
  <h4>CC is not and will not be supported</h4>
  <p>
    While Sims 4 Toolkit works great for files related to gameplay (tuning,
    SimData, images, and string tables), it does not support many file types
    related to CC, such as object catalogs, rigs, and ASMs. For these kinds of
    files, you must use Sims 4 Studio. However, you can include these packages
    within your S4TK project's source code to merge them into other built
    packages.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    There are no plans to add support for CC to the S4TK extension, as S4TK
    itself does not support it either.
  </p>
  <h4 class="mt-4">It's for building packages only</h4>
  <p>
    Other limitations of the S4TK VS Code extension include its current lack of
    non-build-related features, such as extracting tuning. For this, you'll
    either have to use Sims 4 Studio,
