  The S4TK config only affects project-level settings, but there are some more
  options you can choose that affect how the S4TK extension behaves overall.
  This article explains how to view and edit settings, <em>not</em> which
  settings are available and what they mean. For those details, read the
  <a href="#/features/s4tk-settings">S4TK Settings feature page</a>.

  <h2>How to Access Settings</h2>
  <p>
    There are two ways to edit your VS Code settings, either with the settings
    menu or by editing the JSON file.
  </p>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Using the settings menu</h4>
  <p>
    To open the settings menu, you can use
    <mark class="keystroke"
      ><span class="macos">âŒ˜ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke">,</mark>. This will open a tab where you can
    view all of your VS Code settings, including settings for extensions. Click
    "Extensions" in the left-side menu, and scroll down to "Sims 4 Toolkit".
    From here, you can read about available settings and choose what you want
    them to be.

      data-src="s4tk-settings-ui.png"
      alt="Screenshot of S4TK Settings"
    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">Sims 4 Toolkit Settings Within VS Code</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Using the settings JSON</h4>
  <p>
    If you prefer to edit your settings manually, you can do that as well. To
    open the JSON file where your settings are stored on disk, press the "Open
    Settings (JSON)" button in the top-right of your settings UI tab.
  </p>
  <div class="feature-img-wrapper">
    <img
      class="feature-img"
      data-src="vscode-settings-button.png"
      alt="Screenshot of VS Code Settings Button"
    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">VS Code "Open Settings (JSON)" Button</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    After clicking this, the following JSON file will appear. Of course yours
    will be different depending on your settings, but you can edit your S4TK
    settings by typing them in as a new property. This JSON file has full
    intellisense, and will also tell you when you've set something to an
    incompatible value.
