  The best way to learn the S4TK VS Code extension is by jumping right on in and
  playing around with it. For this, there is a sample project baked-in to the
  extension, and you can generate it with a simple command.

  <h2>Creating the Sample Project</h2>
  <p>
    Once you've installed the Sims 4 Toolkit extension in VS Code, open a new
    folder to use as your sample project's workspace (<strong>File</strong> &gt;
    <strong>Open Folder...</strong> in the menu bar). Then, open the command
    palette with
    <mark class="keystroke"
      ><span class="macos">⌘ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke"><span class="macos">⇧&nbsp;</span>SHIFT</mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke">P</mark>, and type in "Create Sample S4TK
    Project" in the textbox that appears. Select it using
    <mark class="keystroke">&darr;</mark>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke"
      >&uarr;</mark
    >, and press
    <mark class="keystroke"
      ><span class="macos">RETURN</span><span class="windows">ENTER</span></mark
    >.

    After generating the sample project, a file called
    <code>HowToUseS4TK.md</code> should automatically be opened in an editor.
    You can read through this for an explanation about the workspace that was
    just generated, otherwise, just poke around the files yourself, read their
    comments, and maybe run a build by right-clicking the
    <code>s4tk.config.json</code> file.
