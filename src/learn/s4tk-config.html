  The S4TK config is a JSON file that marks a workspace folder as an S4TK
  project. When in the root of your VS Code workspace, it powers the build
  script without requiring you to write any code of your own.

  <h2>How to Create the Config</h2>
  <p>
    There's no magic to the S4TK config, it's just a JSON file named
    <code>s4tk.config.json</code>. You can either create this file yourself, or
    right-click the file explorer and use the "Create S4TK Config" command that
    appears in the context menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="font-bold danger">IMPORTANT:</span> The S4TK config
    <strong>must</strong> be in the root of your VS Code workspace, or the
    extension will not be able to find it.

    Once you have an S4TK config file, you should see a message popup saying
    "S4TK Config Successfully Loaded". This is how you know the S4TK extension
    was able to find your config, and will be able to use it while building.

    You can also silence this popup

  <h2>Editing the Config</h2>
  <p>
    You must edit the S4TK config as plain text, as there is no other UI for it.
    If you're uncomfortable with JSON syntax, the S4TK extension provides full
    intellisense and validation, so that you can be confident that you are using
    it correctly.
  </p>

    If you've used XML for TS4 modding, JSON should not scare you.

    "Intellisense" is a fancy word for "the editor tells you what things mean,
    and suggests possible values." You can hover over anything in the config to
    see a tooltip that explains what it is for, and when you start typing, you
    will get suggestions for values to use, such as <code>true</code> /
    <code>false</code> for booleans, or <code>""</code> for strings.

    You'll know that a value you set in the config is of the correct type,
    because if not, you'll see it underlined in yellow and get an error message
    when you save the file, as seen below.

  <p>
    This validation helps ensure that your config is structured correctly, but
    does not guarantee that your logic is correct, such as how you set up your
    glob patterns in <code>buildInstructions</code>. If you don't know what a
    glob pattern is, that's fine - the next section explains what they are, how
    you're supposed to use them, and how the S4TK extension helps you get them
    right.

    If you don't know what <code>**/*</code> is, it is called a "glob pattern".
    Misuse of glob patterns is the most likely cause of logic errors in an S4TK
    config, but the build process safeguards against these issues for you by
    default. The next section will explain what glob patterns are, how you
    should use them, and how the S4TK extension helps you get them right.

    Misuse of glob patterns is the most likely cause of logic errors in an S4TK
    config, but the build process safeguards against these issues for you by
    default. Using the default <code>buildSettings</code> guarantees that:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Every package's glob patterns match at least one file within source, i.e.
      no packages will be empty

    <li>
      Every file within source is matched by at least one package's glob
      patterns
    </li>
    <li>
      No files within source is matched by more than one package's glob patterns
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This means that every file within your source folder will be written to one
    and only one package. This is most likely the behavior you want, since
