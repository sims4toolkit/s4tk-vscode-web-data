<p>
  The S4TK config is a JSON file that marks a workspace folder as an S4TK
  project. When in the root of your VS Code workspace, it powers the build
  script without requiring you to write any code of your own.

  <h2>Creating the Config</h2>
  <p>
    There's no magic to the S4TK config, it's just a JSON file named
    <code>s4tk.config.json</code>. You can either create this file yourself, or
    right-click the file explorer and use the "Create S4TK Config" command that
    appears in the context menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="font-bold danger">IMPORTANT!</span> The S4TK config
    <strong>must</strong> be in the root of your VS Code workspace, or the
    extension will not be able to find it.

    Once you have an S4TK config file, you should see a message popup saying
    "S4TK Config Successfully Loaded". This is how you know the S4TK extension
    was able to find your config, and will be able to use it while building.

    You can also silence this popup

  <h2>Editing the Config</h2>
  <p>
    You must edit the S4TK config as plain text, as there is no other UI for it.
    If you're uncomfortable with JSON syntax, the S4TK extension provides full
    intellisense and validation, so that you can be confident that you are using
    it correctly.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    If you've used XML for TS4 modding, JSON should not scare you.

    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Intellisense" is a fancy word for "the editor tells you what things mean,
    and suggests possible values." You can hover over anything in the config to
    see a tooltip that explains what it is for, and when you start typing, you
    will get suggestions for values to use, such as <code>true</code> /
    <code>false</code> for booleans, or <code>""</code> for strings.
  </p>
  <div class="feature-img-wrapper">

    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">Intellisense in the S4TK Config</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    You'll know that a value you set in the config is of the correct type,
    because if not, you'll see it underlined in yellow and get an error message
    when you save the file, as seen below.
  </p>

    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">Validation in the S4TK Config</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    This validation helps ensure that your config is structured correctly, but
    does not guarantee that your logic is correct, such as how you set up your
    glob patterns in <code>buildInstructions</code>. If you don't know what a
    glob pattern is, that's fine - all you need to know about them is explained
    or linked to in the following section.
  </p>

  <h2>Setting the Build Instructions</h2>

  <p>
    The <code>buildInstructions</code> is the most important part of the config,
    because it is what tells the build script which files to include in which
    packages. It does this using glob patterns, which find files whose paths
    have something in common.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    If you're confused about glob patterns, you should read
    <a href="#/learn/glob-patterns">Glob Patterns</a>.
  </p>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Keeping things simple</h4>
  <p>
    If you're just building all of your files to one package, then use the
    default value of <code>**/*</code>. This glob pattern matches every file in
    any number of subfolders within your source folder, and should suffice for
    most use cases.
  </p>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Building multiple packages</h4>
  <p>
    When building multiple packages (such as for pack-dependent features or
    optional add-ons), you have to write include/exclude glob patterns to
    specify which source files go to which packages. This can be tricky to get
    right if you're not familiar with glob patterns, and can be the source of
    some bugs:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your patterns might not return any matches (package will be empty)</li>
    <li>Your patterns might miss some files (mod will be incomplete)</li>
    <li>Your patterns might have overlap (files will be duplicated)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The good news is, the S4TK extension protects you against all three of these
    potential bugs by default, which helps ensure that your glob patterns are
    working the way you intend them to. If any source files are missed or
    repeated, and if any package's patterns do not have any matches, you will
    see a fatal build error, like this:
  </p>
  <div class="feature-img-wrapper">
    <img
      class="feature-img"
      data-src="build-error-overlap.png"
      alt="Screenshot of S4TK Build Failure Error"
    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">Build Failing Because of Glob Overlap</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Advanced users with legitimate reasons for doing so may toggle these
    safeguards off using <code>buildSettings</code>. For instance, if you're
    intentionally having packages overlap because you're outputting two
    "flavors" of the same functionality, you can set
    <code>buildSettings.allowPackageOverlap</code> to <code>true</code>.
  </p>
