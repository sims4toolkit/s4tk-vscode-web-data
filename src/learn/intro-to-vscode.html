  This article is intended for Sims 4 modders who have never used VS Code
  before. If you are already familiar with VS Code or other IDEs, then feel free
  to skip ahead to
  <a href="#/learn/intro-to-s4tk-extension">Intro to the S4TK Extension</a>. If
  you'd like to learn about VS Code in general, rather than specifically using
  it for Sims 4 modding, you should instead read the
  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs" target="_blank">official docs</a
  >.

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"
      >Visual Studio Code</a
    >
    is a free, cross-platform code editor created by Microsoft. It is highly
    customizable thanks to its extension marketplace, where you can download
    add-ons that alter its appearance and/or abilities (just like mods!).
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    Download for Windows, macOS, or Linux at the above link.
  </p>
  <p>
    VS Code works with actual files and folders on your computer's file system,
    rather than virtual documents within a package, like Sims 4 Studio does.
    Each project you work on in VS Code must exist within a single folder; when
    you open this folder in VS Code (<strong>File</strong> &gt;
    <strong>Open Folder...</strong> in the menu bar), it is called a workspace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within your workspace, you can create, view, edit, move, rename, and delete
    files, just as you would in <span class="macos">macOS Finder</span
    ><span class="windows">Windows Explorer</span>, but with a rich code editor.
    The workspace folder can also contain special files, such as the S4TK config
    or the .vscode folder, which tell VS Code how to behave while working on
    your current project.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    You'll read more about the S4TK config and .vscode folder in other articles.

  <h2>User Interface</h2>
  <p>
    This section introduces areas of the UI that are relevant while using the
    S4TK extension. For a more complete introduction to the VS Code user
    interface in general, please read the
    <a
      href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface"
      target="_blank"
      >official "User Interface" docs</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    The majority of the time you're working in VS Code, you'll be looking at
    something like this:
  </p>
  <div class="feature-img-wrapper">
    <img
      class="feature-img"
      data-src="vscode-layout.png"
      alt="Screenshot of VS Code with the S4TK Extension"
    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">VS Code with the S4TK Extension</p>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>File Explorer</strong>: View and edit the contents of your
      workspace folder. Click files to open them in a new editor tab.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      <strong class="text-subtle">Tip</strong>: Single-clicking will open a new
      temporary tab. To keep a file open, double-click it.
    </p>
    <li>
      <strong>Editor Tabs</strong>: Switch between the editors you currently
      have open.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      <strong class="text-subtle">Tip</strong>: If a tab's title is written in
      <em class="text-subtle">italics</em>, it is temporary, and will be
      replaced when you open another file.
    </p>
    <li><strong>Editor</strong>: View and edit the contents of a file.</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      <strong class="text-subtle">Tip</strong>: You can have multiple editors
      open side-by-side for easy comparison.
    </p>
    <li>
      <strong>Context Menu</strong>: Perform actions on a file/folder by
      right-clicking them in the explorer or editor tabs.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      <strong class="text-subtle">Tip</strong>: Many of S4TK's commands are
      within context menus, so you don't have to run them manually.
    </p>
    <li>
      <strong>Information Message</strong>: Displays information such as
      confirmations, warnings, and errors.
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      <strong class="text-subtle">Tip</strong>: S4TK makes use of these popups
      often, but you can silence some using the S4TK Settings.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Another immensely useful part of the user interface is the
    <strong>Command Palette</strong>, i.e. where you can run commands by name.
    To open the command palette, press
    <mark class="keystroke"
      ><span class="macos">⌘ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke"><span class="macos">⇧&nbsp;</span>SHIFT</mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke">P</mark>. The command palette will open at
    the top of VS Code, like so:
  </p>
  <div class="feature-img-wrapper">
    <img
      class="feature-img"
      data-src="vscode-command-palette.png"
      alt="Screenshot of the VS Code Command Palette"
    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">The VS Code Command Palette</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Type in any part of the name of the command you're looking for, and you
    should see it suggested. You'll read more about useful commands and commands
    provided by S4TK in other articles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, you'll likely notice that your user interface looks different than
    mine in terms of coloring, icons, and elements in the status bar (bottom
    part of VS Code). This is because I have several extensions installed that
    alter the appearance of VS Code and add new functionality. Using extensions
    is an integral part of using VS Code, and you'll read about that next.

  <h2>Finding &amp; Installing Extensions</h2>
  <p>
    You can browse available extensions on the
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode" target="_blank"
      >online VS Code marketplace</a
    >, or within VS Code itself by clicking on the extension tab in the activity
    bar (or by pressing
    <mark class="keystroke"
      ><span class="macos">⌘ CMD</span><span class="windows">CTRL</span></mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke"><span class="macos">⇧&nbsp;</span>SHIFT</mark
    >&nbsp;<mark class="keystroke">X</mark>). This will open the extension
    marketplace in the side bar, replacing the file explorer. You can click on
    extensions to open them in an editor tab to read more and install.
  </p>
  <div class="feature-img-wrapper">
    <img
      class="feature-img"
      data-src="vscode-marketplace.png"
      alt="Screenshot of the VS Code Extension Marketplace"
    />
    <p class="text-sm text-subtle">The VS Code Extension Marketplace</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    You can download extensions for themes, icon sets, certain programming
    languages, niche purposes (like Sims 4 Toolkit), etc. While you shouldn't go
    overboard with extensions, I'd recommend taking some time to browse and see
    what's available; the beauty of VS Code lies in its customizability, so you
    should take advantage of that.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    The extension shown in the screenshot is the Atom One Dark theme, which is
    featured in all of the screenshots on this website.

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>
    There is a wealth of information on how to use VS Code in their
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs" target="_blank"
      >official docs</a
    >, as well as elsewhere online, such as Stack Overflow and YouTube. If you
    have a question, chances are it's been asked before. Search it, and you'll
    probably find your answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you use Sims 4 Studio for creating tuning mods, you should read
    <a href="#/learn/s4s-vs-vscode">Sims 4 Studio vs. VS Code</a>, as it
    compares the two and explains the advantages and limitations of using VS
    Code for Sims 4 modding.
